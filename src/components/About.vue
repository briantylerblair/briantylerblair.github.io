          <p>My name is Brian Blair and I am currently diving deep into the world of VueJS, electron and NodeJS. I have been web design hobbyist for over 6 years
          and have experience in Wordpress, Bootstrap, Foundation, JQuery and Javascript. I will speak a lot about VueJS which is a Javascript framework for fast prototyping and development
          of webapps. This site is currently using a framework based on VueJS called Quasar Framework. I have worked in Information Technology for over 7 years in a support role but have decided
          to move on from supporting hardware to designing software. I hope you enjoy my site and maybe learn a little from it!</p>
