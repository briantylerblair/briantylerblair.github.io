I will speak a lot about VueJS which is a Javascript framework for fast prototyping and development\n        of webapps. This site is currently using a framework based on VueJS called Quasar Framework. I have worked in Information Technology for over 7 years in a support role but have decided\n        to move on from supporting hardware to designing software. I hope you enjoy my site and maybe learn a little from it!")])])])])])}]}}});
